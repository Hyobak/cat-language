  <p>Cats communicate with their eyelids—how open or closed they are—as well as with the dilation of the pupil (black portion of the eye). A sudden dilation (enlarging) of the pupil results from sudden arousal which could be due to fear, interest, or any other strong emotion. Wide-open eyes show trust while narrowing the eyes to a slit can signal fear or aggression. If your cat shows droopy, sleepy-looking eyelids, this is a sign that your cat is relaxed and trusting. Try a slow blink and see if your cat blinks back, showing a "kitty kiss" of affection. But if your cat is staring at another cat without blinking, that is a sign of dominance or aggression.</body>
